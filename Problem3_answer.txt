Problem Set 3 - Questions
A. Periodic Task Scheduling:

For scheduling periodic tasks, I would recommend using Celery with a message broker like RabbitMQ or Redis. Celery is reliable and can handle a large number of tasks, making it suitable for production environments. It scales well and allows for distributed task processing. If not using Celery, a simple cron job could suffice for smaller applications, but it lacks the flexibility and reliability of Celery.
B. Flask vs. Django:

Use Flask when you need a lightweight, micro-framework for small applications or APIs where you want more control over components. It's great for prototyping and when you want to avoid the overhead of a full-stack framework.
Use Django for larger applications that require a robust framework with built-in features like ORM, authentication, and admin interface. Django is better suited for projects that need rapid development and scalability.
